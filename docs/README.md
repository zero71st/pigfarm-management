## Documentation Structure

- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)**: Quick setup and getting started guide
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**: System architecture and technical overview
- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Production deployment instructions
- **[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md)**: Operational procedures and maintenance
- **[IMPORT_API.md](IMPORT_API.md)**: POS integration and import procedures

## Development Setup

1. Open solution folder `src` in VS Code / terminal
2. Run server:
```
dotnet run --project .\server\PigFarmManagement.Server\PigFarmManagement.Server.csproj
```
(Default: http://localhost:5000 if you set ASPNETCORE_URLS; otherwise shown in output.)
3. Run client:
```
dotnet run --project .\client\PigFarmManagement.Client\PigFarmManagement.Client.csproj
```
4. Open the client dev URL printed (typically https://localhost:7xxx) and ensure the server base address in `Program.cs` matches the server port.

## Next Steps

* Add proper solution file & projects referencing (generate via `dotnet new sln && dotnet sln add ...`)
* Implement authentication & roles
* Persist data to Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* Integrate POSPOS API sync
* Add reporting & printing endpoints
* Refactor into layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
