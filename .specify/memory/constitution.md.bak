# PigFarmManagement — Project Constitution

Ratification Date: TBD

## Mission
I want to manage my customer pig pen, for buying feed, recording deposits, and harvesting pigs.

## Scope
This constitution governs project-level principles, ownership, and propagation rules for templates and documentation in the PigFarmManagement repository.

## Governance Principles

1. Purpose
- The project exists to provide accurate farm operations management: pig pen lifecycle, feed management, deposits, and harvest tracking.
- Features and changes must support the mission or be explicitly approved by the owner.

2. Data Integrity
- Historical records (feed assignments, harvests, invoices) are authoritative once locked or closed.
- Migrations must preserve existing historical data and provide repair/maintenance endpoints.
- UI must never allow edits that violate locked historical data.

3. Simplicity & Minimalism
- Prefer simple, maintainable implementations (avoid unnecessary complexity).
- Feature interfaces should be straightforward for single-owner workflows.
- Avoid heavy institutional processes for change control on this individual project.

4. Ownership & Amendments
- Single owner model: the project owner may propose and approve amendments.
- The owner is responsible for ratification, test validation, and merging changes.
- Emergency fixes may be applied directly by the owner and documented.

## Amendment Procedure
- Who may propose: Project owner only (single-owner model).
- Approval: Project owner signs off (merge commit).
- Effective: Changes take effect once merged into `main`.
- Record: Each amendment must include a short rationale in the commit message and a link to the related issue or PR if applicable.

## Compliance & Review Cadence
- Review cadence: On demand by the owner (owner-initiated).
- Major reviews: Owner should review before any personal major releases.

## Template Sync & Propagation
- Templates to update: all project templates (plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md, commands/*.md, README.md, PENDING_TASKS.md) when constitution text meaningfully changes.
- Automatic propagation: yes — the owner has approved automatic propagation to project templates. Back up local template edits before running propagation.

## Maintenance & Contacts
- Constitution owner: single owner (maintainer). Contact details intentionally omitted by owner request.
