  - ‚úÖ Allow different customers to have different deposit rates (1000, 1500, etc.)
  - ‚úÖ Update all deposit calculations to use custom amounts
  - ‚úÖ Maintain backward compatibility with existing pig pens

- [x] **Deposit Calculation Enhancement** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - ‚úÖ Add deposit per pig configuration (1500 baht default)
  - ‚úÖ Show expected deposit amount (pig qty √ó deposit per pig)
  - ‚úÖ Display current total deposits and remaining amount
  - ‚úÖ Add visual progress indicators for deposit completion
  - ‚úÖ Update Add/Edit Deposit dialogs with calculation display

- [x] **Feed Formula vs Actual Feed Visualization** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - ‚úÖ Created backend API endpoints for feed progress data
  - ‚úÖ Implemented FeedProgressService with bag conversion logic
  - ‚úÖ Added progress calculation algorithms (required vs actual bags)
  - ‚úÖ Created status indicators (On track, Over-feeding, Under-fed, etc.)

  - ‚úÖ Implemented horizontal progress bar matching deposit progress style
  - ‚úÖ Added proper status chips and remaining amount display
  - ‚úÖ Created color-coded progress indicators with consistent styling

- [x] **üîß FIX: Feed Progress Calculation Error** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
