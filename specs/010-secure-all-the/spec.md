# Feature Specification: Server-Side Endpoint Security (Implemented)

**Feature Branch**: `010-secure-all-the`  
**Created**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Type**: Security & Authentication Infrastructure  
**Input**: User description: "secure all the server-side endpoint without add new table"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "secure all the server-side endpoint without add new table" - requests comprehensive endpoint protection with configuration-based approach
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: API consumers, administrators, unauthorized users
   ‚Üí Actions: authenticate, authorize, validate requests, log security events
   ‚Üí Data: API requests/responses, configuration files, log files
   ‚Üí Constraints: no new database tables, existing endpoints must remain functional
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Authentication method: Use existing API Keys table for endpoint protection

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: What authentication method should be used for securing the API endpoints? ‚Üí A: API Keys - using existing API Keys table that is implemented
- Q: What authorization granularity should be implemented for controlling access to endpoints? ‚Üí A: Role-based - Users have roles (Admin, User) that grant access to endpoint groups
- Q: What rate limiting thresholds should be applied to different types of endpoints? ‚Üí A: Moderate - 500 requests/hour for general APIs, 200 for admin endpoints
- Q: What level of detail and retention period should be used for security event logging? ‚Üí A: None - Skip security event logging to keep implementation simple
- Q: What session timeout duration should be used for API sessions? ‚Üí A: Standard - 2 hours idle timeout with manual session refresh required

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an API consumer, I need all server-side endpoints to be properly secured so that only authorized users can access the system, malicious requests are blocked, and the system remains available under normal and attack conditions, all without requiring new database tables or complex infrastructure changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid authenticated user, **When** they make a request to any protected endpoint, **Then** the system validates their credentials and processes the request successfully
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they attempt to access protected endpoints, **Then** the system denies access with appropriate error messages
3. **Given** a user making excessive requests, **When** they exceed configured rate limits, **Then** the system temporarily blocks further requests
4. **Given** malicious input data in a request, **When** submitted to any endpoint, **Then** the system validates and rejects the request before processing
5. **Given** system configuration files, **When** security settings are modified, **Then** the changes take effect without requiring database migrations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration files are corrupted or missing security settings?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests that might exceed rate limits during high traffic?
- How are security settings applied when the application restarts or configuration is reloaded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate all API requests to protected endpoints using existing API Keys table for credential validation
- **FR-002**: System MUST authorize users based on role-based permissions (Admin, User) that control access to endpoint groups
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate all input data against security rules to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement rate limiting with moderate thresholds (500 requests/hour for general APIs, 200 for admin endpoints) using in-memory counters
- **FR-005**: System MUST reject requests with invalid authentication credentials and provide clear error messages
- **FR-006**: System MUST sanitize all output data to prevent information leakage through error messages or responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement request size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks through large payloads
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide consistent error responses that don't reveal sensitive system information or internal structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST support session management with 2-hour idle timeout and manual session refresh using in-memory storage
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate API versioning and reject requests to deprecated or unsupported endpoints
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce HTTPS for all communications [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: certificate management preferences and SSL/TLS configuration requirements]
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement proper CORS policies to control cross-origin access from web applications
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide security monitoring capabilities with configurable alerting [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: alert delivery methods and threshold sensitivity levels]
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoint contracts while adding security layers
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow configuration-based security policy updates without application code changes
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle security feature failures gracefully without breaking existing functionality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Security Configuration**: Defines authentication methods, user credentials, permissions, and security policies stored in configuration files
- **Rate Limit Policy**: Specifies request thresholds, time windows, and enforcement rules for different endpoint categories
- **Session Token**: Manages user authentication sessions with expiration, validation, and cleanup stored in memory
- **Input Validation Rule**: Defines data format requirements, security checks, and sanitization rules per endpoint
