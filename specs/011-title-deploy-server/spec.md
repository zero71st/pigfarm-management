# Feature Specification: Deploy server to Railway Postgres and seed admin

**Feature Branch**: `011-title-deploy-server`  
**Created**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Connect the server to PostgreSQL on Railway, run EF migrations, and provide a safe admin seeding path for production using ADMIN_* env vars. Provide deployment scripts and CI guidance."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "Connect the server to PostgreSQL on Railway, run EF migrations, and provide a safe admin seeding path for production using ADMIN_* env vars. Provide deployment scripts and CI guidance."
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: DevOps/maintainer, System Administrator, CI pipeline
   ‚Üí Actions: configure DATABASE_URL, run EF migrations, seed admin user/API key, deploy server to Railway, set environment secrets
   ‚Üí Data: connection string (DATABASE_URL), admin secrets (ADMIN_PASSWORD, ADMIN_APIKEY), migration artifacts
   ‚Üí Constraints: production safety (do not leak secrets), ability to run migrations reliably, compatibility with Railway environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Do you want automatic migrations on app startup, or prefer CI/one-off migration runs?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: In production, should the seeder refuse to run if ADMIN_PASSWORD/ADMIN_APIKEY are missing?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Scenarios cover successful deploy, first-time database init+seed, secret provisioning, and rotation.
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is focused on safe provisioning, migrations, and deploy reproducibility.
6. Identify Key Entities (configurations and secrets)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] remain, note them for follow-up
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the deployment must achieve and WHY (reliability, safety)
- ‚ùå Avoid low-level implementation details in this spec (scripts and CI steps belong to the plan/tasks sections)
- üë• Written for maintainers and DevOps engineers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Functional Requirements, Key Entities, Review checklist
- **Optional sections**: Edge-case testing steps, rollback guidance (include because this is deploy-related)

### For AI Generation
1. Mark all ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
2. Prefer secure defaults: require provided secrets in production; allow generation in development only.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the server to Railway with a PostgreSQL database, ensure EF Core migrations are applied, and have an initial admin account created safely so that the application is operational after the first deploy without exposing secrets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh Railway Postgres database and required environment variables are set, **When** the deployment runs, **Then** EF Core migrations are applied successfully and the application starts without errors.
2. **Given** no admin user exists in the database, **When** the seeder runs with ADMIN_PASSWORD and ADMIN_APIKEY provided, **Then** an admin user and hashed API key are created and no secrets are written to logs.
3. **Given** no admin credentials are provided in a development environment, **When** the seeder runs, **Then** a secure password and API key are generated and printed once to the startup output for developer capture (not in production).
4. **Given** the database already contains an admin, **When** deployment runs, **Then** the seeder is a no-op and existing credentials are preserved.
5. **Given** a migration failure or connectivity issue, **When** deployment attempts to start, **Then** the process fails fast with clear error output and does not start the web host.

### Edge Cases
- Partial migrations: ensure migration process is atomic or the deploy fails and rolls back.
- Secret rotation: provide guidance to create new API key and remove old one without downtime.
- Railway connection string differences (e.g., SSL requirement) must be handled by configuration.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a DATABASE_URL environment variable (Railway Postgres) and connect to it at startup when present.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support running EF Core migrations against the configured database prior to starting the web host.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a safe admin seeding mechanism that:
  - creates an admin user only if none exists,
  - uses ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, and ADMIN_APIKEY environment variables when provided,
  - generates secure credentials automatically in non-production only,
   - does NOT print generated secrets when running with ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production.
   - In Production, the seeder MUST refuse to run (fail startup) if ADMIN_PASSWORD or ADMIN_APIKEY are missing.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide deployment scripts or entrypoint examples that run migrations and then start the application in the Railway environment.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow migrations to be executed from CI or a one-off deployment console as an alternative to automatic startup migration.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST require that ADMIN_PASSWORD and ADMIN_APIKEY are provided via the hosting platform secret store for production-first deployments (or fail startup with a clear error), to avoid secret leakage.

- **FR-007**: The system MUST log non-sensitive seeding events (e.g., "seeded admin user" or "admin exists") but never log raw passwords or API keys in production.

### Non-functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Deployment scripts must exit with non-zero status on migration failure (fail fast).
- **NFR-002**: The seeder must be idempotent.
- **NFR-003**: Any generated secrets in development must be strong (at least 96 bits entropy) and printed exactly once.
- **NFR-004**: The deployment process must support zero-downtime migrations or provide rollback guidance.

### Key Entities
- **DATABASE_URL**: Connection string for Postgres provided by Railway.
- **ADMIN_USERNAME / ADMIN_EMAIL / ADMIN_PASSWORD / ADMIN_APIKEY**: Environment variables used by seeder.
- **Migration Job**: The migration operation and its status (success/failure).

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Database connection to Railway Postgres is documented and tested.
- [ ] EF Core migrations can be run from CI and as part of startup entrypoint.
- [ ] Seeder behavior is documented for dev vs production environments.
- [ ] Deployment scripts and Railway start command examples are present in the repo (or documented).
- [ ] Secrets are provisioned via Railway environment variables and not leaked in logs.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: Do you want EF Core migrations applied automatically when the app starts, or do you prefer migrations run from CI / a one-off migration job? ‚Üí A: A

Applied clarification: The deployment shall use automatic startup migrations. The spec and requirements are updated accordingly: the application will run EF Core migrations at startup and must fail fast (exit non-zero) if migrations cannot be applied. In production the migration step must avoid printing secrets and should be guarded by robust connectivity and retry logic in the startup path.

- Q: In Production, should the seeder refuse to run when ADMIN_PASSWORD or ADMIN_APIKEY are missing (fail startup), or auto-generate an admin? ‚Üí A: A

Applied clarification: In Production the seeder will refuse to run and the application must fail startup with a clear error if `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_APIKEY` are missing. This is to ensure secrets are provisioned via the platform secret store and avoid accidental production secret leakage.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
