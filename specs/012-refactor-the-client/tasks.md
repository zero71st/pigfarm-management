# Tasks: Client-Side Code Refactoring

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-refactor-the-client/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: C# .NET 8, Blazor WebAssembly, MudBlazor UI Components
   → Structure: Feature-based organization (Authentication, Customers, PigPens, Dashboard)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 6 refactoring entities (Debug Artifacts, Code Duplication, etc.)
   → contracts/: Refactoring service interfaces and validation contracts
   → research.md: Microsoft coding standards, feature-based organization decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: backup, analysis tools, structure documentation
   → Validation: manual testing checklist for functionality preservation
   → Core: debug removal, duplication consolidation, organization, standards
   → Integration: namespace updates, dependency resolution
   → Polish: final validation, documentation updates
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files/features = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file modifications = sequential (no [P])
   → Manual process focused (no automated tests per user request)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Focus on manual refactoring and validation steps
```

## Dependencies

**Setup Dependencies**:
- T001 must complete before any refactoring begins
- T002-T003 can run in parallel after T001
- T004-T006 can run in parallel but should complete before core refactoring

**Core Refactoring Dependencies**:
- Debug artifact scanning (T007-T010) can run in parallel
- Debug artifact removal (T011-T014) must be sequential, one feature at a time
- Import standardization (T015-T018) can run in parallel after debug removal
- Duplication analysis (T019-T022) can run in parallel
- T023-T024 must be sequential (create utilities before using them)

**Organization Dependencies**:
- Feature organization (T025-T028) can run in parallel
- Standards and comments (T029-T033) depend on organization completion
- T034-T035 must be sequential after all refactoring changes

**Final Phase Dependencies**:
- T036 must complete before T037-T040
- T037-T038 can run in parallel
- T039-T040 must be sequential as final steps

## Parallel Execution Examples

# T007: Scan Authentication for debug artifacts
# T008: Scan Customers for debug artifacts
# T009: Scan PigPens for debug artifacts
# T010: Scan Dashboard for debug artifacts

# Phase 3.4 - Import organization can run in parallel:
# T015: Standardize Authentication imports
# T016: Standardize Customers imports
# T017: Standardize PigPens imports
# T018: Standardize Dashboard imports
```

## Manual Testing Focus

Per user request, this refactoring focuses on manual validation rather than automated testing:

- Each task includes manual validation steps
- Comprehensive functionality checklists provided
- Build validation after each major phase
- Step-by-step rollback procedures available
- Manual testing guidance for all features
- Performance validation through manual observation

## Notes

- All tasks preserve existing functionality (no breaking changes)
- Focus on maintainability improvements through organization and cleanup
- Manual validation approach ensures thorough testing without automated overhead
- Incremental approach allows rollback at any stage
- Feature-based parallel execution maximizes efficiency
- Microsoft coding standards ensure consistency across codebase
