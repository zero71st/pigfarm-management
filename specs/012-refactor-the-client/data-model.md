# Data Model: Client-Side Code Refactoring

**Feature**: 012-refactor-the-client  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Refactoring Entities

### 1. Debug Artifacts
**Description**: Console logging statements and temporary debug code that need removal

**Attributes**:
- Type: console.log, console.debug, console.info, console.warn, console.error
- Location: File path and line number
- Context: Surrounding code for validation
- Status: Identified, Reviewed, Removed

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Identified** - Found during scanning
2. **Reviewed** - Validated as safe to remove
3. **Removed** - Deleted from codebase

### 2. Code Duplication Patterns
**Description**: Repeated code blocks that should be consolidated into reusable utilities

**Attributes**:
- Pattern: Type of duplication (logic, styling, structure)
- Occurrences: Number of instances (minimum 2)
- Locations: List of files containing the pattern
- Complexity: Lines of code or logical complexity
- Consolidation Target: Proposed utility location

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Detected** - Found during analysis
2. **Analyzed** - Evaluated for consolidation value
3. **Consolidated** - Extracted to reusable component/utility
4. **Replaced** - Original instances updated to use consolidated version

### 3. File Organization Units
**Description**: Components, services, and pages that need reorganization

**Attributes**:
- Current Path: Existing file location
- Target Path: Desired location in feature-based structure
- Type: Component (.razor), Service (.cs), Page (.razor)
- Feature: Business capability (Authentication, Customers, PigPens, Dashboard)
- Dependencies: Other files that reference this unit

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Mapped** - Current location identified
2. **Planned** - Target location determined
3. **Moved** - File relocated to new structure
4. **Updated** - References and namespaces corrected

### 4. Import Dependencies
**Description**: Using statements and dependency declarations that need standardization

**Attributes**:
- Type: System, Third-party, Project
- Namespace: Full namespace path
- Usage: Referenced in file or unused
- Order: Current position vs. standard position

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Scanned** - Current imports identified
2. **Classified** - Categorized by type
3. **Ordered** - Arranged per Microsoft standards
4. **Cleaned** - Unused imports removed

### 5. Coding Standard Violations
**Description**: Code patterns that don't follow Microsoft C#/Blazor conventions

**Attributes**:
- Type: Naming, Structure, Pattern, Documentation
- Current: Existing implementation
- Standard: Microsoft convention requirement
- Impact: Breaking change or compatible fix

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Detected** - Non-standard pattern found
2. **Evaluated** - Impact assessment completed
3. **Fixed** - Updated to follow standard
4. **Verified** - Functionality preserved

### 6. Comment Artifacts
**Description**: Comments that need review for business value vs. dead code

**Attributes**:
- Type: Single-line (//), Multi-line (/* */), XML documentation (///)
- Content: Business logic explanation vs. commented-out code
- Decision: Keep, Remove, Modify
- Location: File and line context

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Identified** - Comment found during scan
2. **Classified** - Business value vs. dead code
3. **Processed** - Kept, removed, or modified per classification

## Relationships

### File Organization → Dependencies
- File moves require updating all import statements
- Namespace changes cascade to dependent files
- Component references need path corrections

### Code Duplication → File Organization
- Consolidated utilities affect feature organization
- Shared components may need common location
- Cross-feature dependencies influence structure

### Debug Artifacts → Coding Standards
- Debug removal may reveal standard violations
- Clean code practices reduce need for debug statements
- Standard formatting improves debug identification

## Validation Rules

### Debug Removal
- All console.* statements must be identified and removed
- No production logging should be accidentally removed
- Conditional debug code must be completely eliminated

### Code Consolidation
- Minimum 2 occurrences required for consolidation
- Consolidated code must maintain all original functionality
- No performance degradation from abstraction

### File Organization
- All files must follow feature-based structure
- Namespace must match physical file location
- Dependencies must resolve correctly after moves

### Standards Compliance
- All code must follow Microsoft C#/Blazor conventions
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Consistent formatting across all files

## State Transitions

```
Debug Artifacts: Identified → Reviewed → Removed
Code Patterns: Detected → Analyzed → Consolidated → Replaced
Files: Mapped → Planned → Moved → Updated
Imports: Scanned → Classified → Ordered → Cleaned
Standards: Detected → Evaluated → Fixed → Verified
Comments: Identified → Classified → Processed
```
