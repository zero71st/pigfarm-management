# Implementation Plan: Client-Side Code Refactoring

**Branch**: `012-refactor-the-client` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-refactor-the-client/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Refactor client-side Blazor WebAssembly code to improve maintainability through: complete removal of ALL debug logging (console.log/debug/info/warn/error), feature-based organization grouping code by business capability, consolidation of duplicate code patterns appearing 2+ times, and adherence to Microsoft's official C#/Blazor coding conventions while preserving all existing functionality.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# .NET 8, Blazor WebAssembly  
**Primary Dependencies**: MudBlazor UI Components, ASP.NET Core Web API client  
**Storage**: N/A (client-side refactoring only)  
**Testing**: Not generating unit/integration test files per user request  
**Target Platform**: Blazor WebAssembly (browser-based)
**Project Type**: web (frontend refactoring focus)  
**Performance Goals**: Improved code maintainability, faster developer navigation  
**Constraints**: Must preserve all existing functionality, no breaking changes  
**Scale/Scope**: Client-side codebase with Authentication, Customers, PigPens, Dashboard features

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity & Minimalism**: ✅ PASS - Refactoring maintains simple, maintainable implementation without adding complexity

**Data Integrity**: ✅ PASS - Client-side refactoring does not affect historical records or data persistence

**Feature Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Aligns with feature-based architecture principle by organizing client code by business capability (Authentication, Customers, PigPens, etc.)

**Backwards Compatibility**: ✅ PASS - Refactoring preserves all existing functionality, no breaking changes to contracts

**Quality Gates**: ✅ PASS - Code review and testing gates maintained, changes are isolated to code organization

**Structure Decision**: Web application with existing feature-based structure. The refactoring will enhance the current organization by consolidating code within features, removing debug artifacts, and ensuring consistent patterns across all feature modules.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Produce contract artifacts** from contracts:
   - Produce API contracts (OpenAPI) for operators and integrators.

4. **Extract manual validation scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → a manual validation checklist used during deployment verification.
   - Quickstart includes step-by-step manual validation steps (no automated tests are created by default).

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Debug artifact removal → scanning and removal tasks
- Code duplication analysis → detection and consolidation tasks
- File organization → planning and execution tasks
- Import standardization → formatting and cleanup tasks
- Coding standards → review and application tasks
- Comment cleanup → review and processing tasks
- Each quickstart phase → corresponding implementation task
- Validation tasks for functionality preservation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Preparation tasks first (backup, analysis)
- Non-destructive changes first (imports, formatting)
- Structural changes second (file moves, organization)
- Code consolidation third (duplication removal)
- Validation tasks after each major phase
- Final verification and documentation updates

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on manual refactoring process

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (N/A - no violations)
