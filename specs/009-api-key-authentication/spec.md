## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The PigFarm Management System currently lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, creating security risks and limiting the ability to control access to sensitive farm data and operations. The system needs a secure, manageable authentication approach that balances security with operational simplicity.


### Solution Approach
Implement an API-key based authentication system where administrators manage all user accounts and generate secure API keys. The system includes a production-safe admin seeder:
- On startup, if no admin exists, creates one using environment variables (ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, ADMIN_APIKEY).
- In production, requires secrets to be set (no secret printing); in development, generates and logs them once for convenience.
- For Railway/Postgres, set secrets in Railway variables before first deploy; seeder will not print secrets in production.
This approach provides strong security controls while maintaining operational simplicity for small to medium farm operations.

### Success Criteria
- **Security**: All sensitive operations require valid authentication and appropriate authorization
- **Manageability**: Administrators can easily create, manage, and revoke user access
- **Usability**: End users have a simple login experience with persistent authentication
- **Auditability**: All authentication and authorization events are logged and traceable
- **Scalability**: System can grow from single-admin to multi-admin scenarios

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Actors
- **System Administrator**: Manages user accounts, generates API keys, controls access
- **Farm Manager**: Daily operations user with elevated permissions
- **Farm Worker**: Limited access user for basic operations
- **External API Consumer**: Automated systems or integrations requiring programmatic access

### Core User Journeys

#### 1. Administrator Manages Users
**As a System Administrator, I want to manage user accounts so that I can control who has access to the farm management system.**

**Steps:**
1. Administrator logs into admin interface with their credentials
2. Navigates to user management section
3. Creates new user account with username, email, and assigned roles
4. Generates initial API key for the user
5. Securely communicates credentials to the user
6. Monitors user activity and manages ongoing access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Admin can create user accounts with username, email, and role assignments
- ‚úÖ Admin can generate multiple API keys per user for different devices/applications
- ‚úÖ Admin can view all active users and their current API keys
- ‚úÖ Admin can deactivate users or revoke specific API keys instantly
- ‚úÖ All administrative actions are logged with timestamp and admin identity

#### 2. User Authentication Flow
**As a Farm Manager, I want to log into the system securely so that I can manage farm operations.**

**Steps:**
1. User enters username and password on login page
2. System validates credentials and generates new API key
3. User receives API key (shown once for security)
4. User's client application stores API key securely
5. Subsequent requests include API key in X-Api-Key header
6. System validates API key and grants access based on user roles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Valid username/password combination generates a new API key
- ‚úÖ API key is displayed to user exactly once after generation
- ‚úÖ Invalid credentials result in clear error message without revealing user existence
- ‚úÖ API keys include expiration date and can be configured for different lifespans
- ‚úÖ User can have multiple active API keys for different devices

#### 3. API Key Usage and Validation
**As a Farm Worker, I want my authentication to work seamlessly so that I can focus on farm tasks without authentication interruptions.**

**Steps:**
1. User's application automatically includes API key in request headers
2. System middleware validates API key against stored hash
3. System loads user identity and role information
4. Request proceeds with populated security context
5. Endpoint authorization checks user roles against required permissions
6. Operation executes or returns authorization error

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Valid API key grants access to appropriate system functions
- ‚úÖ Invalid or expired API key results in 401 Unauthorized response
- ‚úÖ Role-based authorization prevents access to unauthorized functions
- ‚úÖ API key validation is performant and doesn't impact system responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Security context is properly populated for all authenticated requests

#### 4. Security Incident Response
**As a System Administrator, I want to quickly revoke access when needed so that I can respond to security incidents.**

**Steps:**
1. Administrator receives report of suspicious activity or security concern
2. Quickly identifies affected user account(s)
3. Immediately revokes all API keys for affected user(s)
4. Reviews audit logs to assess impact
5. Generates new credentials if user access should be restored
6. Documents incident and response actions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ API key revocation takes effect immediately across all system components
- ‚úÖ Revoked keys cannot be used for any system access
- ‚úÖ Audit trail shows all key generation, usage, and revocation events
- ‚úÖ Administrator can bulk-revoke keys or revoke individual keys selectively
- ‚úÖ System provides clear feedback about revocation success

### Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### Concurrent Key Usage
- **Scenario**: Same API key used simultaneously from multiple locations
- **Expected**: System allows concurrent usage but logs all access points
- **Security**: Monitor for unusual geographic or temporal patterns

#### Key Rotation
- **Scenario**: User needs to rotate API key due to potential compromise
- **Expected**: Admin can generate new key while old key remains valid for transition period
- **Security**: Clear expiration policy and transition management

#### System Recovery
- **Scenario**: Authentication system database corruption or loss
- **Expected**: Recovery procedures that don't compromise security
- **Security**: Secure backup and recovery processes with admin verification
