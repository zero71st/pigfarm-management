# Feature Specification: Import POSPOS Stock to Feed Formula

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to import stock to Feed Formula from POSPOS sytem (stock data), so that I want to use this information to show in pigpen feed history (code,name,unit name), and I want to use cost in Feed furmala to caculate to spacial price to know about profit, quantity use stock in order list of POSPSTransaction"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What are the explicit out-of-scope items for this feature? (e.g., authentication, reporting, etc.) ‚Üí A: as is feature, no auth
- Q: How does the Feed Formula relate to POSPOS Transaction in terms of data flow? (e.g., one-to-one mapping, batch import, etc.) ‚Üí A: one to many, per invoice
- Q: What is the critical user journey for importing and using the stock data? (e.g., trigger import, view history, calculate profit) ‚Üí A: trigger import
- Q: What are the failure modes for POSPOS integration? (e.g., network failure, invalid data, rate limiting) ‚Üí A: Network timeout
- Q: What are the key edge cases for stock data handling? (e.g., zero stock, duplicate codes, invalid units) ‚Üí A: Duplicate product code

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a farm manager, I want to import stock data from the POSPOS system into the Feed Formula so that I can use the product information (code, name, unit name) in the pigpen feed history display and calculate profit by using the cost to determine special prices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** POSPOS has stock data for a product, **When** importing to Feed Formula, **Then** the Feed Formula should contain the stock quantity, product code, name, unit name, and cost.
2. **Given** a pigpen feed history view, **When** displaying feed items, **Then** it should show the product code, name, and unit name from the imported Feed Formula.
3. **Given** a Feed Formula with cost data, **When** calculating special price for profit, **Then** it should use the cost from the Feed Formula to determine the special price.
4. **Given** a user triggers the import process, **When** the import completes successfully, **Then** Feed Formula items are created with stock data from POSPOS.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when POSPOS stock data is missing or invalid for a product?
- How does the system handle multiple products with the same code in POSPOS?
- What if the POSPOS transaction order list has zero or negative stock quantities?
- What happens when POSPOS integration fails due to network timeout?
- How does the system handle duplicate product codes in stock data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST import stock data from POSPOS system into Feed Formula entities.
- **FR-002**: System MUST use product code, name, and unit name from Feed Formula in pigpen feed history display.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use cost from Feed Formula to calculate special price for profit determination.
- **FR-004**: System MUST use stock quantity from POSPOS transaction order list for feed calculations.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feed Formula**: Represents feed products with stock data, including code, name, unit name, and cost imported from POSPOS. One POSPOS Transaction can create multiple Feed Formula items per invoice (one-to-many relationship).
- **POSPOS Transaction**: External transaction containing order list with stock quantities for products, linked to multiple Feed Formula items.

## Out-of-Scope
- Authentication and authorization
- Reporting features beyond feed history display
- User management
