# Feature Specification: Enhanced Customer Management

**Feature Branch**: `008-update-manage-customer`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update manage customer feature, I want to delete customer, and update existing customer (manual update,update from pos api), add google map location, and I can swith between card view (default) and table view"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: delete customer, update customer (manual + POS API), Google Maps location, view switching
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: farm administrators/managers
   ‚Üí Actions: delete, update (manual/automatic), view location, switch views
   ‚Üí Data: customer records, location coordinates
   ‚Üí Constraints: default card view, integration with POS API
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What triggers automatic updates from POS API?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What customer fields can be updated manually vs automatically?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should location be editable or display-only on map?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: manage customers through enhanced interface
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Customer with location data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What should trigger automatic updates from the POS API? ‚Üí A: Manual trigger by admin users
- Q: When there's a conflict between manual updates and POS data during sync, which should take precedence? ‚Üí A: POS data always wins (external system is authoritative)
- Q: How should customer location data be managed? ‚Üí A: Manual coordinate entry only (latitude/longitude input fields)
- Q: What should be considered valid location data? ‚Üí A: Any latitude (-90 to 90) and longitude (-180 to 180) values
- Q: What customer fields should be updateable manually versus only through POS sync? ‚Üí A: All fields except coordinates updateable both ways

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a farm administrator, I want to manage customer information more effectively by being able to delete outdated customers, update customer details both manually and automatically from our POS system, view customer locations on a map, and switch between card and table views to optimize my workflow for different tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm viewing the customer management page, **When** I select a customer and choose delete, **Then** the customer is permanently removed from the system after confirmation
2. **Given** I'm editing a customer record, **When** I update customer details manually and save, **Then** the changes are persisted and visible immediately
3. **Given** the POS system has updated customer information, **When** the automatic sync occurs, **Then** customer records are updated with the latest POS data
4. **Given** a customer has location information, **When** I view their details, **Then** I can see their location plotted on Google Maps
5. **Given** I'm on the customer management page, **When** I toggle the view mode, **Then** I can switch between card view (default) and table view
6. **Given** I'm in table view, **When** I switch back to card view, **Then** the system remembers this as my preferred default view

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to delete a customer who has active pig pens or transactions?
- How does the system handle conflicts between manual updates and automatic POS updates?
- What happens when Google Maps fails to load or customer has invalid location data?
- How does the system behave when POS API is unavailable during sync?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authorized users to permanently delete customer records
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent deletion of customers with active business relationships (pig pens, transactions)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide manual editing capabilities for all customer fields (FirstName, LastName, Code, Phone, Email, Address, KeyCardId, Sex, Zipcode, location coordinates)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide manual sync capability for admin users to trigger customer data updates from POS API
- **FR-005**: System MUST give precedence to POS data during sync conflicts (POS system is authoritative source)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display customer locations on Google Maps integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow manual entry of customer location coordinates (latitude/longitude input fields)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide card view as the default customer display mode
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to switch between card view and table view
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist user's preferred view mode across sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST show confirmation dialog before deleting customers
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all customer deletion and update activities for audit trail
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate location coordinates are within valid ranges (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
- **FR-014**: System MUST gracefully handle Google Maps service unavailability

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Customer**: Core entity with basic information (name, contact details), location coordinates (latitude/longitude), POS system reference ID, audit fields (created/updated timestamps, last sync date)
- **Location**: Geographic coordinates and address information associated with customer, integration with Google Maps display
- **Audit Log**: Record of all customer modifications including deletions, manual updates, and automatic syncs with timestamps and user attribution
