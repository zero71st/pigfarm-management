## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: Where should the POSPOS API credentials be stored? ‚Üí A: Environment variables on the server / CI

- Q: How should partial matches be handled? ‚Üí A: Overwrite internal record with POSPOS data; if POSPOSId not found, create new customer

## User Scenarios & Validation *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator I want to import customers from the POSPOS system into PigFarmManagement so that new customers and their identifiers are available inside the app for mapping and imports.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated POSPOS endpoint and valid API credentials, **When** the operator runs the import, **Then** new customers from POSPOS are created in PigFarmManagement and mapped in `customer_id_mapping.json`.
2. **Given** a POSPOS customer that already maps to an existing internal customer, **When** the import runs, **Then** the existing internal customer is not duplicated and mapping is preserved or updated per operator choice.
3. **Given** an API error from POSPOS, **When** the import runs, **Then** the system surfaces a clear error message and partial imports are rolled back (or reported) per the import mode.

### Edge Cases
- Large customer lists (pagination) ‚Äî import must handle paging or batch processing.
- Duplicate POSPOS customer codes across pages ‚Äî deduplicate by POSPOS ID.
- Network failures/timeouts ‚Äî import must be resumable or report the failure and state what partial results occurred.
- Missing required fields in POSPOS payload ‚Äî skip such records and report them in an import summary with reasons.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to the POSPOS customer API using operator-provided credentials and fetch customers.
- **FR-002**: System MUST map POSPOS customer identifiers to internal customer records, storing mapping in `customer_id_mapping.json` or an equivalent mapping store.
- **FR-003**: System MUST not create duplicate internal customers for already-mapped POSPOS customers; it MUST provide an option to update mapping if needed.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an import summary showing counts created, skipped, updated, and errors with reasons.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support pagination/batching for large result sets from the POSPOS API.
- **FR-006**: System MUST surface clear errors on authentication failure or API errors and should not silently swallow failures.

*Ambiguities / Clarifications required:*
- **FR-007**: POSPOS credentials SHALL be provided via environment variables on the server/CI.
- **FR-008**: On partial match, POSPOS data SHALL overwrite the internal record. If the POSPOSId does not exist in the mapping, create a new internal customer and record the mapping.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **POSPOSCustomer**: External customer record from POSPOS (POSPOSId, FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email, Address, CreatedAt)
- **CustomerMapping**: Mapping between POSPOSId and internal CustomerId (POSPOSId ‚Üí InternalId)

## Implementation notes (developer)

- A minimal Pospos client, importer service, and file-based mapping store were scaffolded in the server project as part of initial implementation. See `src/server/.../Services` for implementation.
- The importer reads the POSPOS API using an `apikey` HTTP header. The typed options class is `PosposOptions` and is bound from configuration (section `Pospos`).
- Mapping file: `customer_id_mapping.json` at repo root; written atomically with a `.bak` created on overwrite when persistence is requested.
- Current status: models, client, mapping store and importer implemented; controller endpoints implemented and build passing. Contract tests and automated test scripts are intentionally left to the developer to implement as preferred.



---

*Notes / Next Steps*
- Confirm where POSPOS credentials should be securely stored and how operators provide them.
- Decide desired duplicate-resolution behavior (skip, update, prompt).
- Plan for a small import UI or admin CLI with an import summary and logs.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
